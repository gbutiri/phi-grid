# PHI Grid
A grid layout that embraces the use of the Golden Ratio, or Phi, or approximately 1.618:1. The Golden Ratio has proven to be a positive vibe type of ratio. Nature is based on it, and so are we. Think of Leonardo Da'Vinci's Vitruvian Man.

## Flexbox friendly.
The PHI Grid was developed to be used with flexbox style attributes.

## Easier on the eye
The Golden Ratio has a certain visual quality to itself that displays a sort of a calm.

# How to use
Use bootstrap to initialize rows, columns, and a plethora of other useful styles. Then, instead of using col-12 or col-md-5, simply use the class you want for the row, phi2 or phi3 or phi3b, and then col-sm or col-lg to render either the 1.618 or 1 side of the ratio. See example index.html file.
